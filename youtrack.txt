The 'query' can combine attribute filters, keywords, and free text. Examples of common patterns include:\n\n- Free text: Find matching words in the issue summary, description, and comments. Use wildcards: '*' for any characters, '?' for single characters (e.g., 'summary: log*', 'fix??'). Examples: 'login button bug', 'some other text', 'summary: log*', 'description: fix??'.\n- Linked issues: '<linkType>: <issueId>' (by link type), 'links: <issueId>' (all linked to issueId issues). Examples: 'relates to: DEMO-123', 'subtask of: DEMO-123' (issues where DEMO-123 is a parent), 'links: DEMO-12' (issues linked to DEMO-12 with any link type). Hint: get_issue returns 'linkedIssueCounts' property which shows the available link types for the issue.\n- Issues where an issue is mentioned: 'mentions: <issueId>'. Examples: 'mentions: DEMO-123'.\n- Project filter: 'project: <ProjectName>'. Use project name or project key. Examples: 'project: {Mobile App}', 'project: MA'.\n- Assignee filter: 'for: <login>'. Use 'me' for the currently authenticated user. Examples: 'for: me', 'for: john.smith'.\n- Reporter filter: 'reporter: <login>'. Use 'me' for the currently authenticated user. Examples: 'reporter: me', 'reporter: admin'.\n- Tag filter: 'tag: <TagName>'. Wrap multi-word tags in braces { }. Examples: 'tag: urgent', 'tag: {customer feedback}'.\n- Field filter: '<FieldName>: <Value>'. For any project field, for example, State, Type, Priority, and so on. Wrap multi-word names or values in { }. Use get_project to get the possible fields and values for the project issues to search. Use '-' as 'not', e.g., 'State: -Fixed' filters out fixed issues. Examples: 'Priority: High', 'State: {In Progress}, Fixed' (searches issues with 'In Progress' state + issues with 'Fixed' state), 'Due Date: {plus 5d}' (issues that are due in five days).\n- Date filters: 'created:', 'updated:', 'resolved date:' (or any date field) plus a date, range, or relative period. Relative periods: 'today', 'yesterday', '{This week}', '{Last week}', '{This month}', etc. Examples: 'created: {This month}', 'updated: today', 'resolved date: 2025-06-01 .. 2025-06-30', 'updated: {minus 2h} .. *' (issues updated last 2 hours), 'created: * .. {minus 1y 6M}' (issues that are at least one and a half years old).\n- Keywords: '#Unresolved' to find unresolved issues based on the State; '#Resolved' to find resolved issues.\n- Empty/Non-Empty Fields: Use the 'has: <attribute>'. Example: 'has: attachments' finds issues with attachments, while 'has: -comments' finds issues with no comments. Other attributes: 'links', '<linkType>' (e.g. 'has: {subtask of}'), 'star' (subscription), 'votes', 'work'.\n- Combining filters: List multiple conditions separated by spaces (logical AND). For OR operator, add it explicitly. Examples: '(project: MA) and (for: me) and (created: {minus 8h} .. *) and runtime error' (issues in project MA and assigned to currently authenticated user and created during last 8h and contains 'runtime error' text), '(Type: Task and State: Open) or (Type: Bug and Priority: Critical)'.\n\nReturns basic info: id, summary, project, resolved, reporter, created, updated and default custom fields.
